                    <strong>Ticket Purchasing</strong>
                    <p class="mbr-text font-light display-4">
                    Tickets are sold on behalf of DataConf by Quicket or Fizz Marketing. Do not purchase tickets from any
                    source other than these two authorised agencies. Tickets purchased from any other source may be
                    unauthorised copies and may be refused admittance to the conference. All fees become payable at
                    the time the booking for the conference is made. If this fee remains unpaid at the time of the
                    conference, you may be denied entry to the conference or workshop, with no reduction in your liability
                    to pay the fee. For manual ticket bookings through Fizz Marketing, tickets will only be reserved for 3
                    weeks from the date of invoice sent. Should payment not be received by the deadline the tickets will
                    be released. The cut off for manual ticket bookings through Fizz Marketing is two weeks before the
                    event date. Look after your ticket(s) as you would cash. It must be presented to gain admittance to the
                    conference. The code on the ticket uniquely identifies this ticket and the purchaser and can be
                    redeemed only once. Multiple copies of this ticket will not allow multiple entries. If multiple copies of
                    this code are presented at the conference, DataConf and its authorised agencies may refuse entry to
                    all ticket holders presenting tickets with this code.
                    </p>

                    <strong>Transfers, Cancellations and Refunds </strong>

                <p class="mbr-text font-light display-4">
In the event of the conference being cancelled, the purchase will be refunded via the same payment
method with which the original purchase was made within 3 weeks. In the event of a postponement,
purchased tickets for the original date will be valid for the new date unless otherwise notified.
Purchasers have the option to seek a refund for the value of the purchased ticket(s) for a postponed
event by contacting us after the announcement of the new conference date. In the event of the refund
being authorised for a postponed event, the refund will be processed via the same payment method
with which the original purchase was made within 3 weeks. If you have booked for the conference and
are unable to attend, you may transfer your ticket to another person by logging into Quicket and
updating the ticket details not less than 72 before the conference. To cancel a booking for a
conference, please email us. A full refund can only be provided if notice is received at least 45 days
before the event. A 50% refund is offered if notice is received at least 15 days before the event.
A 25% refund is offered if notice is received at least 5 days before the event, after which no refund will
be issued. These timelines apply for the original event date, and if the event is postponed. If you
have a medical reason for not being able to attend, please email us the doctors note, and we will
convert this ticket to a virtual event ticket. Medical refunds can only be applied for on a per person
basis and as such bulk bookings cannot be refunded in this way (i.e., you can claim a refund for some
tickets of a bulk booking this way, but each needs to be applied for individually for the specific
person). In the case of hospitalisation or death, a full refund will be provided. These are granted at the
discretion of the organising committee and a medical certificate may be requested. All refunds are
less applicable bank changes and Quicket booking fees.
