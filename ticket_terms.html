                <ul class="list mbr-fonts-style display-7">DataConf may change or amend these Terms &amp; Conditions of sale at any time.&nbsp;&nbsp;<div><br></div><div><strong>Ticket Purchasing&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Tickets are sold on behalf of DataConf by Quicket or Fizz Marketing. Do not purchase tickets from any</div><div>source other than these two authorised agencies.&nbsp;Tickets purchased from any other source may be</div><div>unauthorised copies and may be refused admittance to the conference. All fees become payable at</div><div>the time the booking for the conference is made. If this fee remains unpaid at the time of the</div><div>conference, you may be denied entry to the conference or workshop, with no reduction in your liability</div><div>to pay the fee. For manual ticket bookings through Fizz Marketing, tickets will only be reserved for 3</div><div>weeks from the date of invoice sent. Should payment not be received by the deadline the tickets will</div><div>be released. The cut off for manual ticket bookings through Fizz Marketing is two weeks before the</div><div>event date. Look after your ticket(s) as you would cash. It must be presented to gain admittance to the</div><div>conference.&nbsp;The code on the ticket uniquely identifies this ticket and the purchaser and can be</div><div>redeemed only once. Multiple copies of this ticket will not allow multiple entries.&nbsp;If multiple copies of</div><div>this code are presented at the conference, DataConf and its authorised agencies may refuse entry to</div><div>all ticket holders presenting tickets with this code.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Transfers, Cancellations and Refunds&nbsp;</strong></div><div><br></div><div>In the event of the conference being cancelled, the purchase will be refunded via the same payment</div><div>method with which the original purchase was made within 3 weeks. In the event of a postponement,</div><div>purchased tickets for the original date will be valid for the new date unless otherwise notified.</div><div>Purchasers have the option to seek a refund for the value of the purchased ticket(s) for a postponed</div><div>event by&nbsp;contacting us&nbsp;after the announcement of the new conference date. In the event of the refund</div><div>being authorised for a postponed event, the refund will be processed via the same payment method</div><div>with which the original purchase was made within 3 weeks. If you have booked for the conference and</div><div>are unable to attend, you may transfer your ticket to another person by logging into Quicket and</div><div>updating the ticket details not less than 72 before the conference. &nbsp;To cancel a booking for a</div><div>conference, please&nbsp;email us. A full refund can only be provided if notice is received at least 45 days</div><div>before the event. A&nbsp;50% refund is offered if notice is received at least 15 days before the event.</div><div>A&nbsp;25% refund is offered if notice is received at least 5 days before the event, after which no refund will</div><div>be issued. These timelines apply for the original event date, and if the event is postponed.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you</div><div>have a medical reason for not being able to attend, please&nbsp;email us&nbsp;the doctors note, and we will</div><div>convert this ticket to a virtual event ticket. Medical refunds can only be applied for on a per person</div><div>basis and as such bulk bookings cannot be refunded in this way (i.e., you can claim a refund for some</div><div>tickets of a bulk booking this way, but each needs to be applied for individually for the specific</div><div>person). In the case of hospitalisation or death, a full refund will be provided. These are granted at the</div><div>discretion of the organising committee and a medical certificate may be&nbsp;requested.&nbsp;&nbsp;All refunds are</div><div>less applicable bank changes and Quicket booking fees.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><strong>General</strong>&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Your personal information is held by DataConf and the authorised agencies.
